ttom# TODO: Change texts from "ghibli" to "cartoonify"

- [x] Update src/pages/Index.tsx: Replace all instances of "ghibli" with "cartoonify" in text strings (titles, descriptions, button labels, download filename) and update the fetch URL to point to the new function name.
- [x] Rename supabase/functions/convert-to-cootonify/ directory to supabase/functions/convert-to-cartoonify/.
- [x] Update the renamed supabase/functions/convert-to-cartoonify/index.ts: Change function name, error messages, and prompt text from "ghibli" to "cartoonify".
- [x] Update supabase/config.toml: Change the function name from "convert-to-ghibli" to "convert-to-cartoonify".
- [ ] Test the application to ensure the renamed function works correctly and UI displays "cartoonify".
